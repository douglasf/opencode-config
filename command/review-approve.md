description: "[DEPRECATED] This command has been removed — task approval is now automatic on commit or via natural language"

This command has been removed. Task approval now happens through two mechanisms:

1. **Automatic on commit**: Running `/commit` automatically moves all `in_review` tasks to `done`.
2. **Natural language**: Just tell the orchestrator to approve tasks (e.g., "approve the tasks", "LGTM", "ship it").

There is nothing to do here. If you meant to approve tasks, just say so in chat or use `/commit`.
